### About

I was born and brought up in the city of Ranchi, the capital of Jharkhand. I spent my entire childhood in Ranchi and went to DPS, so yes my childhood was filled with Monday Tests (my fellow dipsites will understand). The best thing I learned from DPS is how to spend most of my time in the field/court without being noticed (by the teachers! if you know what i mean).I made some great friends there some of them even helped me in creating this website (Samar Eqbal). I am currently in Bengaluru (Karnataka) and I'm a student in PESU first year (at the time of making of this website), and I have to say PESU is just like DPS(85% attendance mandatory). I'll add more content to this Website and this section as life goes on so until next time.......!!!!
